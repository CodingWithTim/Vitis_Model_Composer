# Rapid design exploration using Vitis Model Composer<a name="introduction"></a>

Vitis Model Composer provides a library of performance-optimized blocks for design and implementation of DSP algorithms on Xilinx devices. The Vitis Model Composer AI Engine, HLS, and HDL libraries within the Simulink environment, enable the rapid design exploration of an algorithm and accelerates the path to production.

# How to access the examples and tutorials?<a name="access"></a>
    
We are storing and managing Vitis Model Composer examples and tutorials in GitHub. This way, users will have access to the most up-to-date material. You can get the examples and tutorials from GitHub. However, we recommend you get them directly from Vitis Model Composer.

Click [here](./QuickGuides/Get_Examples/README.md) to learn how to access Vitis Model Composer examples and tutorials.

# What is new?
* Take a look at the latest [tutorial series](./Tutorials) on AI Engines. This set of tutorials provides an excellent introduction to AI Engines and guides you through the process of developing a DSP algorithm on AI Engines using Vitis Model Composer.
* The new [Channelizer](./Examples/AIENGINE_plus_PL/AIE_HLS/Channelizer) example implements a high-speed channelizer design using a combination of AI Engine and Programmable Logic (PL) resources in Versal devices.
* The [filtering in frequency doamin]( /Examples/AIENGINE/Filtering_in_frequency_domain/) design showcases filtering in frequency domain in AI Engines and also shows how to increase the throughput using different techniques.
