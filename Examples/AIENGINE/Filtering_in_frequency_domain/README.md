In the frequency domain, the filtering operation involves the multiplication of the Fourier transform of the input and the Fourier transform of the 
impulse response followed by an inverse fourier transofrm.
As the length of the impulse response increases, the frequency-domain filtering technique becomes more efficient compared to time-domain filtering.
