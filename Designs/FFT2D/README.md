# 2D FFT using both AI Engines and Programmable Logic
In this section we showcase two 2D FFT examples using both AI Engines and Programmable Logic. 
Two 1D FFTs are running on AI Engiens and a transpose operation is running on the programmable logic.
In one example, the transpose operation is implemented using the HLS Kernel and in another example the transpose operation is implemted using HDL blocks.

## Examples

- [2D FFT design using AI Engines and HLS Kernel block](rtp_scalar)
- [2D FFT design using AI Engines and HDL blocks](rtp_vector)

## Knowledge nuggets
:bulb: An RTP input can be a scalar or a vector.
